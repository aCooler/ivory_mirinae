## develop

1. install dart dev (2.x.x)
2. pub install
3. open your visual studio code
4. fill your login info at example/blueprint.dart (currently this has only password-grant)
5. run once and remove that id / password info. this generates login info
6. debug

format on save is required if you are not not

after changing entities, you should run build.bat or the command inside it. it regenerates JSON serialization with the json_serializable package
